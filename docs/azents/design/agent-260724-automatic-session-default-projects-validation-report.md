# Automatic Session Default Projects — Phase 5 Validation Report

## Scope and evidence policy

This report validates the `agent-260724` implementation through PR 6 (`feat/agent-default-projects-web`) against the confirmed Requirements, ADR, Design, and Phase 5 plan. It records executable evidence by source:

- **Local** — executed in the current worktree.
- **CI** — executed by GitHub Actions on the stacked PR commit.
- **Static/collection** — source inspection, test collection, generated-contract comparison, or quality checks that do not execute Docker-backed product journeys.
- **Unavailable** — attempted evidence blocked by the local substrate; it is not classified as a product failure.

Living specs were compared read-only. No spec, Requirements, ADR, or primary Design document was changed in this phase.

## Environment

- Worktree: `/workspace/agent/.azents/worktrees/prize-shock-curtain/azents`
- Validation branch: `feat/agent-default-projects-validation`
- Implementation base: `feat/agent-default-projects-web` (PR #852)
- Date: 2026-07-24 (KST)
- Local Docker prerequisite: **unavailable**. `test -S /var/run/docker.sock` returned `docker-socket-absent` (exit 1). Testcontainers consequently failed while creating its Docker network with `docker.errors.DockerException` wrapping `FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory')`.
- No live-provider credentials were used. External Channel scenarios use the repository fake Slack provider and deterministic test credentials only. Feature-specific policy/runtime behavior is exercised through Public API and Runtime boundaries; UI behavior is covered by existing `azents-web` unit/component tests, build, Storybook, and the repository Web Surface regression lane.

| `git diff --check` | PASS | No whitespace errors in the phase diff |

The unavailable local lanes are an infrastructure limitation, not failed assertions. The same lanes are required to complete in CI. The first PR 6 Web Surface run exposed a test-fixture contract defect before the browser journey; the correction and rerun status are recorded below.

## Fixture readiness and test-boundary audit

The new E2E module `testenv/azents/e2e/src/tests/azents/public/test_automatic_session_projects.py` prepares state through supported product boundaries:

- creates Workspace, LLM integration, Agent, policy, and Sessions through generated Public API clients or HTTP API calls;
- creates disposable Runtime directories through `docker exec` against the test Runtime container, and removes one disposable directory through the same Runtime boundary for missing-path validation;
- uses fake Slack HTTP configuration, signed callback admission, generated External Channel API decisions, and public Session Project APIs;
- does not add a feature-specific browser journey; UI behavior is covered by existing `azents-web` unit/component tests, build, Storybook, and the repository's existing Web Surface regression lane;
- does not write product tables directly and does not contain live provider credentials.

A runtime-ready fixture is required for non-empty policy replacement; an explicit empty replacement does not require Runtime readiness. The unavailable-state scenario stops the deterministic Runtime Provider, performs the public API assertions, then waits for a new provider registration before restoring the fixture. This preserves fixture state for later tests.

## Requirement-to-validation matrix

| Requirement/scenario | Primary validation | Evidence/status |
|---|---|---|
| REQ-1: save multiple ordered default Projects | Public GET/PUT helpers and policy repository/service/API tests; UI behavior covered by existing Web tests/build/Storybook | Local backend/API tests and 121 Web tests PASS; PR6 selected deterministic/Web Surface lanes PASS in final CI |
| REQ-2: team-primary receives defaults | `_team_primary_session` followed by public Session Project API | Implemented path and focused tests present; Docker Runtime Provider lane unavailable locally; feature-specific Runtime Provider E2E remains a separate PR7 execution requirement |
| REQ-2: External Channel Allow creates root with defaults | Signed fake Slack admission → approval decision → Session Project API | E2E scenario present; local Docker unavailable; feature-specific Runtime Provider E2E remains a separate PR7 execution requirement |
| REQ-2: already-granted initial binding snapshots | Second resource/channel with same fake Slack principal after `allow_agent`; compare new Session snapshot | E2E scenario present and asserts changed-policy snapshot plus unchanged old Session; local Docker unavailable; feature-specific Runtime Provider E2E remains a separate PR7 execution requirement |
| REQ-3: explicit empty selection wins | Public `POST /chat/v1/agents/{agent_id}/sessions` with `existing_project_paths: []` | E2E assertion and backend tests present; local Docker unavailable; static/API path verified |
| REQ-3: explicit different selection is not merged | Public Session create with one alternate path; exact Session Project response assertion | E2E assertion and root-service tests present; local Docker unavailable |
| REQ-4: old/new snapshots | Existing automatic Session is retained; policy replacement; second automatic Session is compared | External Channel E2E asserts old Session remains on old paths and second Session uses new paths; local Docker unavailable |
| REQ-5: empty policy compatibility | Revision-1 empty policy and explicit clear paths; automatic creation remains available | Policy persistence/service/root tests present; focused local test evidence includes expected Docker skips |
| REQ-6: subagent shared context/no duplicates | Public subagent-tree and Session Project assertions | E2E scenario and root/subagent tests present; local Docker unavailable |
| REQ-7: existing-Project-only/no worktree provisioning | Root service creates context Project rows only; E2E seeds existing directories; no worktree controls in policy API | Static code/test inspection PASS; no new worktree/provider contract detected |
| Missing path save | Remove disposable Runtime directory, PUT complete policy, verify 400 and unchanged revision/policy | E2E scenario present; local Docker unavailable; backend service/API tests PASS from implementation phases |
| Runtime unavailable non-empty + clear | Stop Runtime Provider, verify non-empty 409 stable code, then empty clear 200 | E2E scenario present; local Docker unavailable; feature-specific Runtime Provider E2E remains a separate PR7 execution requirement |
| Concurrent revision conflict | Two expected-revision writes; stale write returns 409 and preserves winner | Repository/service/API tests and policy route tests PASS; E2E scenario support present |
| Web add/reorder/remove behavior | Existing `azents-web` unit/component tests, build, Storybook, and repository Web Surface regression lane | Web tests (121), build, Storybook, lint/typecheck PASS; final Web Surface selected checks PASS in CI; no new runtime-coupled browser journey |

## CI evidence

All timestamps and statuses below are from GitHub Actions on 2026-07-24.

| PR | Run | Branch relationship | Result |
|---|---:|---|---|
| #846 | `30091640958` | `feat/agent-default-projects-policy` → `feat/agent-default-projects-plan` | All required checks passed; deterministic and Web Surface E2E passed |
| #847 | `30091819918` | `feat/agent-default-projects-root-sessions` → `feat/agent-default-projects-policy` | All required checks passed; deterministic and Web Surface E2E passed |
| #848 | `30093103402` | `feat/agent-default-projects-external-channel` → `feat/agent-default-projects-root-sessions` | All required checks passed; deterministic and Web Surface E2E passed |
| #852 | `30098221747` | initial PR6 run | Deterministic E2E passed; Web Surface failed on the coupled feature browser scenario |
| #852 | `30100622354` | intermediate correction run | Deterministic E2E passed; Web Surface failed while diagnosing Runtime/provider readiness |
| #852 | `30101913288` | commit `9e956f82` | **All required PR6 checks passed**; deterministic lane selected 254 non-runtime-provider tests (243 passed, 11 skipped), Web Surface selected 6 existing tests and passed, and aggregate `ci-python-e2e` passed |

Runs `30098221747` and `30100622354` both passed deterministic E2E but failed Web Surface while the feature-specific browser scenario was coupled to Runtime/provider setup. The first run used the durable Provider resource ID where Agent creation requires the logical Provider ID; PR6 commit `f46c0148` corrected the fixture to use `system-docker`. The later run's diagnostics then showed `RuntimeProviderSelectionUnavailable` because the selected Provider capability contract had not yet been accepted, followed by Python 3.14 `FrozenInstanceError` while assigning `__traceback__` to a frozen exception. The latter pair are residual Runtime/provider readiness and frozen-exception observations outside this feature/PR scope. Final run `30101913288` is authoritative for PR6's selected CI lanes, but its deterministic filter explicitly excluded `@pytest.mark.runtime_provider`; the five feature scenarios therefore did not execute in that lane. The Phase 5 workflow correction adds this file to the focused Runtime Provider job for the separate PR7 terminal run.

## Failures and fixes

No approved-feature product implementation defect was identified. The coupled browser scenario first exposed an E2E fixture defect that confused the Provider resource ID with its logical ID; commit `f46c0148` corrected it. The next run exposed Runtime/provider readiness and frozen-exception observations outside this feature scope, and the requester-approved scope then removed the runtime-coupled browser journey. The three local Docker-backed lane attempts remain blocked before fixture initialization by the missing Docker socket. Existing non-Docker quality, contract, focused backend, Web, and Storybook checks passed, and final PR6 CI run `30101913288` passed all selected required lanes. Feature-specific Runtime Provider E2E execution remains a separate PR7 validation requirement.

## Strict implementation versus current living specs

The implementation is aligned with the confirmed Requirements/ADR/Design, but the current living specs have not yet been promoted for this feature. The following are Phase 6 documentation inputs, not Phase 5 code defects:

### Aligned behavior already represented or compatible

- `workspace.md` and `conversation.md` describe Session Project APIs and the Agent Workspace boundary used by the new code.
- `external-channel.md` and the authorization/ingress flows retain the existing connection → binding → resource lock and transaction concepts that the External Channel integration preserves.
- Existing explicit Session Project behavior remains represented by the current Session Project routes.

### Implementation behavior missing from current specs

- `agent.md` does not document Agent-scoped automatic-session Project policy ownership, revisioned ordered paths, AgentAdmin-only GET/PUT management routes, stable policy error codes, or policy repository/service code paths.
- `workspace.md` does not document automatic-session policy persistence, Runtime-backed non-empty replacement validation, empty-clear behavior, coherent policy snapshots, or the distinction from recency-oriented `agent_project_defaults`.
- `conversation.md` does not document explicit versus Agent-default root workspace intent, team-primary winner-only policy application, policy revision provenance, automatic root creation without Runtime I/O, or subagent exclusion from policy application.
- `external-channel.md` does not state that a newly created binding Session snapshots the Agent policy into its root `SessionAgentContext`, while an existing binding reuses its immutable Session snapshot.
- `external-channel-authorization.md` does not describe policy snapshotting in the Allow/new-binding transaction or the already-granted initial-binding path.
- `external-channel-provider-ingress.md` does not describe the already-granted External Channel initial-binding root creation boundary.

### Stale or misleading current-spec language

- `conversation.md` currently models `AgentSession ||--o{ SessionWorkspaceProject` as the ownership relationship. The implementation's authoritative root Project membership is on the shared `SessionAgentContext`; direct context Project rows are inherited by subagent Sessions through the context. Phase 6 should correct the diagram and prose without changing the public Session Project API.
- `workspace.md` presents `SessionWorkspaceProject` as an `AgentSession`-owned resource and groups the legacy recency `agent_project_defaults` alongside policy-related project concepts. Phase 6 should distinguish context-owned immutable snapshots, Agent-scoped recency convenience state, and the new automatic-session policy.
- The External Channel authorization flow says only that an External Channel AgentSession is created when no active binding exists; it omits the shared root creation boundary and policy snapshot, which can make the current behavior appear incomplete.

No current spec contradicts an API response shape or requires a behavior that the implementation removed; the principal drift is omission and stale ownership terminology.

## Blockers and residual risks

1. **Local Docker substrate blocker:** `/var/run/docker.sock` is absent, so deterministic, Runtime Provider, and Web Surface E2E could not execute locally. CI is the authoritative executable source for these lanes.
2. **Feature-specific Runtime Provider E2E evidence:** The five feature scenarios are all marked `runtime_provider` and were excluded by PR6's deterministic `not runtime_provider` filter. The Phase 5 workflow correction now routes the whole file through the existing focused Runtime Provider job; a PR7 run must reach terminal success before feature-specific E2E evidence is complete.
3. **Spec promotion remains outstanding:** current living specs need the Phase 6 updates listed above. This is intentional phase sequencing, not an implementation blocker.
4. **No live-provider evidence:** live Slack was intentionally out of scope; fake Slack coverage is the required credential-free path.

## Phase 6 spec-promotion inputs

Update the five candidate specs listed in the Design/Living Spec Updates section, preserving current API names and adding:

- policy tables, ordered normalized path identity, revision and error semantics;
- AgentAdmin permission boundary and Runtime validation/empty-clear distinction;
- root intent ADT and automatic root snapshot timing;
- team-primary race winner-only application and no Runtime I/O;
- External Channel new-binding and already-granted initial-binding snapshot behavior;
- SessionAgentContext ownership and subagent inheritance/no duplicate registration;
- separation from `agent_project_defaults`, presets, and catalog projections;
- current code paths and `last_verified_at` updates.

## Conclusion

Available evidence supports the approved `agent-260724` product behavior and shows no approved-feature implementation defect. PRs #846, #847, #848, and #852 are green for their selected required CI lanes. Final PR6 run `30101913288` on commit `9e956f82` passed all required selected checks, including the 254-test deterministic lane, six-test Web Surface regression lane, and aggregate `ci-python-e2e`. Local Docker remains unavailable, and the five feature-specific Runtime Provider E2E scenarios remain to be executed separately in PR7.
